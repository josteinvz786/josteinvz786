I enjoy solving data analysis problems using tools such as machine learning, statistics, and programming. In general, I am interested in mathematics and computer science, as they have become powerful elements for generating a more strategic business vision.

I like to stay constantly updated, and I recently completed a technology bootcamp at Practicum, where I was able to put my knowledge into practice in Python, SQL, and machine learning.
